### Part 3:

### What I learned from lab week 2 and week 3:

In the week 2 lab, two main things that I learned was how I was able to connect to a remote server(the lab computer terminal) with my own laptop. It's very interesting how I can have control of it as if I was on the computer itself even though I wasn't. Another thing I learned from the week 2 lab was creating and running servers. I had no idea that was possible through a few methods and a terminal but it is. Now I fully understand how urls work and what each piece of it means in order for the webpage to function properly. In week 3, the new things I learned were the **ssh** keys and how there's both public and private ones. As well the two commands **scp** and **mkdir** that came with them.
